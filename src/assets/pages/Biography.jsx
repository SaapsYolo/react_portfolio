            <h3>My Biography!</h3>
            <p>I am a passionate and driven young developer eager to learn and explore new technologies. With a
            solid foundation in Java, SQL, HTML, and PHP acquired at university, I have also taught myself crossplatform
            mobile development using Flutter. <br/><br/>
            I aspire to become a full-stack developer, leveraging object-oriented programming languages like
            Java, database languages like MySQL, and server-side technologies like PHP. I aim to utilize
            frameworks such as Spring and React to contribute to a companyâ€™s productivity and deliverables while
            advancing my development career. I am actively seeking graduate programs or internships to grow my
            skills and make meaningful contributions.</p>
